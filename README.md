# How It Works

1) Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game in which the players fill up 9 empty rectangles in a table with either an X or an O when it is their turn.
2) Once someone succeeds to line up their sign vertically or horizontally without an interruption, that player wins.
3) Once the user selects one of the players, the selection box will disappear and the playboard is visible.
4) There are the player names at the top in the playboard section and it indicates or shows whose turn is now.
5) At the center of the webpage, there is a tic tac toe play area with nine square boxes. Once you click on the particular box then there is visible a sign or icon which you have chosen on the selection box.
   
**If no one wins the match and all 9-box selected then again the playboard section is hidden and the result box appears with “the game ended in a tie” text and a replay button.

6) Once you click on the replay button, the current page reloads and you can play again.
   
# Project Requirements

1) Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (must be visual and use the DOM not the Console)

2) Hosted on Github pages

3) Commits to Github every day

4) A README.mdfile with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

5) Must be a two player game (either against the computer or against another player)
- Example: Blackjack: A player plays against the dealer. The dealer is the computer - Example: Connect Four: Two players pass the game between themselves to take turns

6) A win state - a way for the player to win the game

7) High score can be considered a win state

8) A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game

9) A way to keep playing if the game is not over

10) Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost
- Example: Blackjack: a player takes turns playing a hand versus a computer - the player's hand can either win, lose or tie the dealer. If the player has enough money in their bankroll they can keep playing. A player must be able to win several rounds and increase their bankroll - Example: Connect Four: two (non-computer) players take turns adding chips to the board. The game will check if a player won or if the board is full and there are no more plays possible. A player gets four chips in a row (vertically or horizontally)- one person wins, one loses, there are no further plays in this case
